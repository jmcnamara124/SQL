# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.

# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into & I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


#1. Determine who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

#2. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT
artist_name
,duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc 
LIMIT 1
;

#3. What is Olivia Rodrigo's most popular song? 
SELECT 
track_name
, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = "Olivia Rodrigo"
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1
;

#4. What is the most danceable song and who is the artist?
SELECT 
track_name
, danceability
, artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 1
;

#5. What is the least danceable song?
SELECT 
track_name
, danceability
, artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability asc
LIMIT 1
;

#6. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
WITH popularity_avg_CTE AS(
SELECT
artist_name
, avg(popularity) as average_popularity 
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name)

SELECT artist_name 
, average_popularity 
, 'Top Star' AS tag 
FROM popularity_avg_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90
;
